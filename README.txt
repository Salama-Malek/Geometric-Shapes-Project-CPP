   ID: [Your Student ID]

3. General explanation of the exercise:
   This project involves implementing four classes representing geometric shapes (Rectangle, Triangle, Window, and Hexagram) and utilizing them to draw shapes on a board. Each class has specific constructors and functions as per the exercise requirements.

4. List of created files:
   - Rectangle.h
   - Rectangle.cpp
   - Triangle.h
   - Triangle.cpp
   - Window.h
   - Window.cpp
   - Hexagram.h
   - Hexagram.cpp
   - Board.h
   - Board.cpp
   - Utilities.h
   - Utilities.cpp
   - Vertex.h
   - macros.h
   - main.cpp
   - CMakeLists.txt
   - README.txt

5. Main data structures and their functions:
   - Rectangle: Represents a rectangle and provides functions to manipulate and retrieve information about the rectangle.
   - Triangle: Represents an equilateral triangle and provides functions for construction and information retrieval.
   - Window: Represents a frame created from two rectangles and provides functions for manipulation and information retrieval.
   - Hexagram: Represents a Star of David created from two triangles and provides functions for manipulation and information retrieval.
   - Board: Provides functions for drawing shapes on a virtual board.
   - Utilities: Contains general auxiliary functions used in implementing the board functions.
   - Vertex: Defines a struct representing a vertex in the plane with x and y coordinates.
   - macros.h: Defines constants COL_MAX and ROW_MAX.
   - main.cpp: Contains the main program to create and draw shapes.

6. Worth knowing Algorithms: 
   - The area and perimeter calculations for each shape.
   - Scaling algorithm for resizing shapes.

7. Known bugs: [If any]
